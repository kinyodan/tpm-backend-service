Backend Service Api

Built a Back-end API applicatiion to serve the Nodejs Back-end Api.Some Data retrival and api calls from and the Iceand fire api took to long to query per request.

So need to take advantage of threading to increase perfomance and also background Jobs to retrive the data in the and ave to database.

Built a Rails API as an RPC service to the node to run the lengthy tasks and have data already saved and packaged for the front-end requests.

The repository for this service is at.
